# ATM Management System - Java Swing Application

This desktop application was created by a team of developers during the second-year project at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering. The project team included Rupesh Poudel, Sameer Khatiwada and Ghanashyam Puri.

## Project Overview

The ATM Management System is a Java Swing-based desktop application that serves as a management system for automated teller machines (ATMs). It provides a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of ATM operations.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

1. **Java Swing**: Used for the front-end development, providing graphical user interface components for the application.
2. **Oracle Database**: Employed as the backend database to store and manage ATM-related data.
3. **ojdbc8**: Oracle JDBC driver used for database connectivity from the Java application.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for authorized access to ATM management functionalities.
- **ATM Operations**: Supports functionalities such as cash withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, and transaction history.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides administrative controls for managing ATM settings and user accounts.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with the Oracle database for data storage and retrieval.

## How to Run

To run the ATM Management System application locally:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Set up an Oracle database with the necessary schema and tables.
3. Configure the database connection parameters in the application using the `ojdbc8` JDBC driver.
4. Compile and run the Java Swing application to start the ATM Management System.
